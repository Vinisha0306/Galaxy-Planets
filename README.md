# ðŸŒŒ Galaxy Planets (Animator) App
- Galaxy Planets (Animator) is an educational app built using Flutter, designed to showcase detailed information about planets in our solar system through engaging animations. It includes features such as implicit animations, explicit animations, themes, local data storage, and more.

## ðŸš€ Features
- 1. Planet Details
Displays information on each planet (name, mass, diameter, etc.).
Beautifully designed planet screens with facts, images, and animated graphics.
- 2. Solar System Visualization
A visual representation of the Solar System.
Planets orbit around the Sun using explicit animations to simulate their movement.
Rotation animations for planets (like Earth spinning) to create a realistic space experience.
- 5. Splash Screen
A stunning splash screen with animations that introduce the app when itâ€™s opened.
## âœ¨ Animations Used
- 1. Implicit Animations
Implicit animations allow the app to automatically animate the transition between two states whenever the widget changes.
Examples include:
AnimatedContainer: Smooth size changes for planet images.
AnimatedOpacity: Fading planet information in and out.
AnimatedCrossFade: Transitioning between different planet views.
- 2. Explicit Animations
Explicit animations give precise control over every step of the animation.
Examples include:
AnimationController and TweenAnimationBuilder for detailed control of planetary orbits and rotations.
Transform for rotating planets around their axis (e.g., Earth spinning).
Solar system animation where each planet follows its orbit in real-time with control over the animation speed and direction.
